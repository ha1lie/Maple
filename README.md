## About

Check out Maple's [website](https://maple.halz.dev)

Maple is the amalgamation of over four months of work, all leading to this one finished product. Maple acts similarly to a jailbreak(the legal process of unsandboxing your device to expand it's functionality) for your Mac. 

## Installing 

To install Maple, follow the directions [on this website](https://maple.halz.dev/install.html)

## Calling All Developers!

Maple was built with a desire to be community driven. While it's initial development was done privately, I'm calling on the opensource community to help me make it even better. Below is a list of ideas you can do to help out, and get some PRs in!

☑️ Improve UI/UX - I'm no designer
☑️ Localize Maple to a language you know
☑️ Improve documentation
☑️ Add new features like better debugging
☑️ Create Leaves for the community
☑️ Anything else! Things only improve when we think out of the box!
